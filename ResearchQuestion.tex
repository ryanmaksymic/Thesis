\chapter{Research Question}

This chapter will provide an in-depth examination of my research question. Through referencing the existing research outlined in the previous section, I will justify the need for my work. I will then explain the steps I will be taking to address this question.

\section{Research Question}

How might technology be used to add participatory elements to traditionally presentational rock and pop concerts?

% Notes:
* How do audiences want to participate? How do performers want audiences to participate?

* Input: How can data best be captured from the audience?

* Output: What can the audience interact with that will enhance the performance but not distract the audience or performer?

* Feedback: What kind of feedback will be informative/useful without being distracting?

* What's the threshold where a performance can no longer be social? What's the ratio where participation can be sustained?

* Many maintain that music is inherently social, so is anyone explicitly calling out presentational performances as unnatural? Should I do this?

* Small shows are much, much cheaper than arena shows, and they offer much more personal experience. So why are we paying \$500 for arena shows? Are we getting our money's worth? Does the spectacle make up for the separation?
