\chapter{Prototype \#3 Circuit Diagram}

\clearpage

The following is a simplified circuit diagram for Prototype \#3. The power source provides 12 V and 1 A. All transistors are P2N2222A NPN devices. Each LED symbol represents a bulb containing a 12-LED array; each bulb pulls approximately 80 mA at 12 V.
