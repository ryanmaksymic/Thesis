Technology has long been used to improve the presentational aspects of a live music performance, but less often is it employed to encourage participation from audience members. This thesis investigates how digital technologies might be used to make traditional pop and rock concerts more participatory. A literature review and survey of related projects were first conducted. Preliminary research was then carried out, including interviews with both concertgoers and performers. Multiple prototypes were developed and tested with users, and, after analyzing the results, a refined device was created and implemented at a live music performance. The paper concludes with a discussion on the significance of the device and possible future directions.
