Musicians and their fans are connecting on an unprecedented level today using the Internet; however, the communication channel is still very one-sided during a live performance. This thesis aimed to develop a new method for audience-to-performer communication. A literature review and survey of related projects were first conducted. Preliminary research was then carried out, including interviews with both concertgoers and performers. Multiple prototypes were developed and tested with users, and, after analyzing the results, a refined device was created and implemented at a live music performance. The paper concludes with a discussion on the significance of the device and possible future directions.
