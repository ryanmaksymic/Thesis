A standard music venue has multi-coloured lights that can be controlled to set the mood of the performance; some artists, however, are not satisfied by this traditional system. Performance artists and electronic musicians have been experimenting with new technologies for years in an attempt to create a more unique and engaging stage show. Recently, many mainstream musicians have started to follow suit, incorporating clever technologies into their performances, leading to exciting experiences for their thousands of fans. Montreal-based studio Moment Factory, for instance, works with musicians like Madonna and Bon Jovi and employs special effects, mechatronics, and electronic devices to create incredible stage shows. For rock band Coldplay's most recent tour, the Xyloband - a wristband containing radio-controlled LEDs - was developed. Stadiums full of people wearing these devices lit up and blinked along with the music. It is becoming increasingly popular to enhance live events using novel technologies; however, these technologies generally lack something that I believe could greatly increase their effectiveness - interactivity.
