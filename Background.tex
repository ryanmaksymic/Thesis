\chapter{Background}

This chapter examines related research and projects. I will focus on music as a social activity and designing for crowds before discussing relevant projects that were successfully executed in real event settings.

\section{Music as a Social Activity}

Investigating music as a social activity will help us understand the roles of the performer and the audience and how they might be modified to enhance a live music performance.

\subsection{Kershaw}

This article examines how the behaviour of London theatre audiences changed over the twentieth century. Kershaw begins by citing a newspaper article claiming that theatre audiences are much more prone to giving standing ovations than they once were. He asserts that investigating this particular trend could tell us more about modern theatre as a whole. It is pointed out that little research has been done on applause as a phenomenon, and Kershaw surmises that this is due to it being taken for granted as a straightforward element of a performance. So, just what is applause? The author proposes that it could be an attempt to extend a performance that one does not want to end, or perhaps it is more ``a giving up of individual judgement" and an attempt at forming a momentary community (p. 135). Regardless, Kershaw maintains that this increasing acquiescence in audiences indicates disempowerment and the fall of the theatre as a political environment. The potential power of an audience is emphasized via a case study: in 1926, an Irish audience rioted during a performance of a controversial play, thereby ending its run and making known the audience's opinion on the play's political issue. This sort of defiant reaction empowers the audience, Kershaw claims, whereas applause seems to actively muffle dissent.

Kershaw proposes that, over the twentieth century, the role of the audience member changed from patron to customer. Pre-World War II spectators had no inhibitions about booing or yelling their approval. In the 50s, however, theatres were becoming increasingly regarded as indicators of status; they were decorated lavishly, and the audience was managed such that certain groups sat in predetermined places. Since the 80s and 90s, most theatres have been filled with advertisements, indulgent services, and merchandise sales. Thus, states Kershaw, ``the standing ovation [became] an orgasm of self-congratulation for money so brilliantly spent," and``political significance, democratic exchange, and the power of community all but evaporated" (p. 144).

The paper closes by recommending that theatres look for ways to encourage conflicting viewpoints in their audiences. The author proposes some admittedly ``desperate" strategies, such as booking audiences with contrasting interests in the show or placing opinionated ``plants" in the crowd to inspire irregular reactions. Kershaw believes that the political potential of the theatre is in danger of being lost and, thus, that ``[it] now, perhaps more than anything else, needs unruly audiences" (p. 151).


\section{Designing for Crowds}

Designing for large groups of people has only recently attracted notable interest in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI). As interactive systems become increasingly ubiquitous, HCI researchers are asking how the needs of multiple people in a public space differ from those of an independent user. The characteristics of live performance make it an especially useful venue for these investigations; thus, conveniently, much of the research done in this field focuses on concerts, theatre performances, and dance clubs.

\subsection{Maynes-Aminzade, Pausch, and Seitz}

In their 2002 paper, Maynes-Aminzade et al. describe three different computer vision systems that allow an audience to control an on-screen game; they also outline the lessons they learned about designing such systems. The first method tracks the audience as they lean to the left and right. The control mechanism was intuitive, but the system required frequent calibration. The second method tracked the shadow of a beach ball which acted as a cursor on the screen. This was also intuitive, but it only involved a few people in the audience at a time. The third method tracked multiple laser pointer dots on the screen, giving each audience member a cursor; this was a more chaotic system once the number of dots got overwhelming. Lastly, the authors presented some guidelines for designing systems for interactive audience participation. They recommend focusing on creating a compelling activity rather than an impressive technology; they state that every audience member does not necessarily need to be sensed as long as they feel like they are contributing; and they suggest that the control mechanism should be obvious or audience members will quickly lose interest. The authors also note that making the activity emotionally engaging and emphasizing cooperation between players will increase the audience's enjoyment.

These conclusions provide both guidance and new questions to consider for my own research. While I hope to work with some relatively advanced technologies, it will be important to remember that it is the actual interaction that will determine how engaging the experience is. User-centered design will need to be a major part of my development process. While this paper dealt with accurate control of a video game, my work will address interactions that are more passive and abstract. The authors stress the importance of an obvious control mechanism; considering how much their environment (a movie theatre) will likely differ from mine (a loud, dark music venue), I believe this will be especially crucial for my project. Audience members whose senses are already being overloaded will have even less patience for figuring out how something works. I will have to consider how this and other factors apply to my unique environment. How can I best tap into the emotional sensibilities of an audience at a concert? How might I create a cooperative environment in a situation that is not goal oriented? These are questions I will have to address in my primary research.

\subsection{Ulyate and Bianciardi}

In their paper, the authors describe their ``Interactive Dance Club" -- a venue that delivers audio and video feedback to inputs from multiple participants -- and they present the ``10 Commandments of Interactivity" that guided its creation. The goals of the project were to create coherent musical and visual feedback for individual and group interactions and to allow non-artistic people to feel artistic. Inputs included light sensors, infrared cameras, pressure-sensitive tiles, proximity sensors, and simple mechanical switches. By interacting with them, users could make notes sound out, manipulate projected video and computer graphics, modulate music loops, and control the position of cameras in the space.

This project's ``10 Commandments of Interactivity" contain the following points:
\begin{itemize*}
	\item Movement is encouraged and rewarded.
	\item Feedback from interactions is immediate, obvious, and meaningful in the context of the space.
	\item No instructions, expertise, or thinking is required.
	\item A more responsive system is better than a more aesthetically pleasing system.
	\item Modularity is key.
\end{itemize*}

Lastly, the authors share the lessons that they learned while running the Interactive Dance Club. They observed that interactions involving full-body movements were most satisfying. The form of an object, they found, determined how users first attempted to interact with it. They emphasize the practicality of a system that is both distributed and scalable. Designing the interactions required finding a balance between freedom and constraint. They found that, no matter how elegant the system, some users would still find a way to create unpleasant noise. Lastly, they observed that instant gratification is important; feedback that is too delayed or interactions that require too much concentration are ineffective.

\subsection{Bongers}

In his 1999 paper, Bongers provides a theoretical HCI framework for physical interaction between performers, audience members, and electronic systems in a musical performance. He defines three types of interaction -- ``performer-system", ``system-audience", and ``performer-system-audience." Bongers models the interactions as control systems wherein actions are either a \emph{control} or \emph{feedback} process. Electronic sensors and actuators are discussed, followed by human senses and motor systems. Bongers states that a more convincing interaction is one that provides ``multimodal" feedback -- influencing more than one of the users' senses. Lastly, a few prototypes of novel interaction systems are described. Especially notable is the ``Interaction Chair", which most easily fits in the performer-system-audience category. Here, the performer has the ability to send vibrations through each audience member's seat back, while the chairs contain sensors that allow audience members to influence visuals projected behind the performer. Other projects like this one can benefit from Bongers' theoretical framework; thinking in terms of control and feedback processes may provide new perspectives on a  system's design.

\subsection{Barkhuus and Jorgensen}

Barkhuus and Jorgensen's paper investigated interactions between audiences and performers at a concert. The authors used observations from traditional rock and rap shows to inform the design of a simple "interaction-facilitation technology" -- a cheering meter. By tracking the applause patterns at several concerts, it was determined that the two most common reasons for cheering were to express anticipation and to reward the performers. This led to the creation of a cheering meter, an instrument for measuring the volume of an audience -- in this case, to determine the winner of a rap battle. Microphones captured samples of the crowd's cheering, the signal was filtered, the peak volume was measured, and the rating on an arbitrary scale was displayed on large screens onstage.

The researchers reported no major issues while testing the system, and they express confidence that their technology helped to enhance the concert for the audience members. In their paper, they outline the main reasons for the cheering meter's success. First, the authors state that the usability of the system is due to the fact that it is based on an already-present behaviour; they recommend ``designing technology that fits the situation and which utilize present activities rather than aiming to employ the latest cutting edge technology" (p. 2929). Next, they suggest that an event should not rely on the success of the technology; the rap battle, for example, could have easily continued if the cheering meter malfunctioned. Lastly, the authors emphasized the importance of immediate visual and/or aural feedback; seeing direct consequences of their actions gives the audience confidence in using the system. This research focused on a very specific type of event using an almost-gimmicky system, but the design principles it yielded are valuable.

\subsection{Tseng et al.}

This paper described the motivation and creative process behind a Taiwanese interactive theatre experience that let audience members connect with a dance performance. The project was realized using projection mapping, a Kinect, a local area network, and a custom iPhone app. Audience members downloaded the app before the show and entered a code corresponding to their seat number to connect to the local network. During the first part of the performance, each user was given control over one ``light dot" projected onto the stage. The dot could be moved by moving the iPhone; users could also point their phone's camera at different light sources to influence the brightness of their dot. Later in the performance, audience members could use their phones to trigger sounds and projected images onstage. The dancer, tracked by the Kinect, interacted with the projections, improvising a dance with the light.

The authors approached this project by asking, ``How can the audience become an essential element in a performance?" (p. 561). They claim that, while new media has been incorporated into theatre for decades, mobile phones have not been used to their full potential. Feedback collected after the performance revealed overall positive reactions. Some users, however, were uncomfortable having their personal devices connected to an unfamiliar network. Another negative was that not every audience member owned an iPhone; one of these spectators, though, maintained that she enjoyed the show even while being excluded from the interaction.

\subsection{Reeves, Sherwood, and Brown}

This paper investigates the design of technology for crowds by observing and analyzing the behaviour of a group of football fans gathered at a pub. The authors note that most related work has focused on spectators at a performance or on exceptional circumstances like riots. This work instead looks at everyday crowd-based settings where there is no attention-grabbing ``spectacle." To accomplish this, the researchers video recorded a crowd gathered at a pub during a football match and examined the group's behaviour for recurring themes. People were seen singing, jumping, and pumping their fists in the air in sync with each other. In general, these instances of collective participation were all visible or hearable from far away. Once a small group of people began the actions, they would quickly ``snowball" and overtake the crowd. Researchers also noticed the importance of ``shared objects;" an inflatable object bouncing between people, for example, connected individuals at a distance. It was also observed, of course, that not every person in the crowd cared to participate in these group activities.

After outlining these observations, the authors present a list of design lessons that they extrapolated. First, they suggest treating a crowd as a unit rather than a collection of individuals -- for example, exploiting already-present crowd behaviours or allowing for only partial participation. The importance of ``intra-crowd interaction" is also emphasized: allow for shared objects and space-dependent interactions, and take advantage of snowballing by encouraging highly visible/audible actions. Additionally, one should allow for interaction with people on the fringes of the crowd but be aware of problems that could be caused by latency. Lastly, the researchers note that every crowd is different and that each design should reflect the nature of the environment.


\subsection{Gates, Subramanian, and Gutwin}

This paper examines the complex interactions between DJs and audience members in nightclubs from an HCI perspective. The authors gathered their information by observing behaviours at nightclubs, surveying DJs, as well as conducting lengthy interviews with them. Most DJs had similar preferences and performance styles. For example, all of the interviewees said they preferred venues where audience and DJ are mutually visible; this allows them to adjust their performance based on visual cues from the audience. Using quick glances, DJs can observe audience members' facial expressions and body language and the flux of people on to and off of the dance floor. Many DJs stated that they will often exaggerate their movement or speak into a microphone to energize the crowd. Small, direct interactions can also occur between DJs and audience members, such as exchanges of facial expressions or gestures. DJs use the information they glean from their audience to shape their performance. Most DJs will craft a playlist before performing based on the venue, event type, and expected audience; during the performance, however, the energy of the crowd ultimately guides how the tracks are mixed. In general, the authors found that, as long as there is sufficient visibility, DJs are extremely competent at adjusting their performance based on the audience. Interviewees saw little need for technology to aid their performances; one of the few wishes the DJs expressed was for a method to discover the musical preferences of a given audience.

Based on the information collected, the authors present some design recommendations for those wishing to bring interactive technologies to nightclubs. For example, they state that, considering how skillful DJs are at observing audiences, any technology meant to gather information from the crowd must be more efficient than DJs themselves. Such technology, the authors suggest, would be most useful for gathering ``invisible" information like musical preferences. They recommend against using biofeedback systems or systems where audiences have a direct influence on the performance; these methods do not help DJs do their job. The researchers state that gradual changes are more satisfying than immediate ones. Lastly, they emphasize the importance of respecting the DJ's art; technologies should allow them to stay in control of the music and should not add to their already-demanding cognitive load.


\section{Notable Precedents}

In the past few years alone, a number of large-scale projects have been realized that use technology to expand live performances into the audience. Some were implemented as experiments at one-time events, while others found commercial success and are being used by big-name companies.

\subsection{Wham City Lights}

Wham City Lights is a smartphone application that allows multiple devices to display light shows in sync during a concert. Audience members with an iOS or Android device can download the app before the show. Once the show has begun, an operator activates lighting cues by playing encoded, ultrasonic tones; devices with the app open ``hear" these tones and perform the corresponding cues. This can be done at nearly any scale as long as every device is able to hear the tones. Users generally hold their devices up or wave them above their heads during the show. Light shows can be created live or programmed in advance using an online editor; cues include flashing colours, camera flashes, GIFs, text, and sound.

The concept was originally developed by US musician Dan Deacon. His intention was to prevent concertgoers from using their personal devices and disengaging during live performances. Deacon tested the app at his own shows and received a positive response. Today, Wham City Lights licenses their general-purpose app for different kinds of events; they also develop custom apps to include branding, tour dates, etc. Musicians and organizations like Brad Paisley, the Billboard Music Awards, and Intel have made use of this technology at their events.

\subsection{Xylobands}

Xylobands are controllable LED wristbands designed to be worn by potentially thousands of users at entertainment events. They are controlled using a proprietary piece of software downloaded to a laptop; the laptop must then be connected to a radio transmitter. With the software, an operator can turn the Xylobands on or off, select which colours are illuminated, and control the speed of the LEDs' flashing. The transmitter has a range of around 300 meters. Each wristband contains a small printed circuit board that holds, among other components, an RF receiver and an 8-bit microcontroller. The electronics are powered by three 3 V coin cell batteries.

The technology was originally developed for the band Coldplay, and wristbands were handed out to all concertgoers during their 2012 world tour. Giving the wristbands to each audience member at every performance reportedly cost the band \euro{}490 000 (around \$680 000 CAD) per night. UK-based toy development company RB Concepts Ltd. are the creators of the Xyloband. Their website advertises that Xylobands can be customized and used at concerts, festivals, sports stadiums, or corporate events.

\subsection{PixMob}

PixMob is a patented wireless technology that enables the control of multiple LED-embedded objects. By giving PixMob objects to spectators, concert producers can create a controllable LED light show within the audience. The objects are activated with signals from infrared transmitters. Like normal lighting fixtures, the transmitters' beams can be shaped with lenses and controlled via the DMX512 protocol. The objects light up when they are hit by a beam, so patterns of moving light can, in essence, be painted across the audience. Light shows are programmed, simulated, and controlled through a software package called LAVA; they can also be controlled in real time using a MIDI controller or the LAVA iPad app. Previous PixMob objects include balls, wristbands, pendants, and beads, and custom object creation is available as well. PixMob also offers ``second life" customization: objects can be programmed to react to sounds, play an mp3 track, or communicate with the user's personal computer after the show is over. Past clients include Microsoft, Arcade Fire, Eurovision, and Heineken.
