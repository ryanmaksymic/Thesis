\chapter{Ethnography}

One of my first goals was to get a sense of modern concertgoers' and performers' feelings about participatory performances and interactive technology. I sent out a brief online survey for music fans that helped me to understand how they generally responded to these topics. Interviews were also conducted with multiple musicians to shed light on their perspectives.

\section{Audiences}

% Explain the content of the survey:
An online survey was created in order to obtain a sample of modern music fans' opinions on interactive performances. The survey was completed by ninety-nine participants recruited via social media. The first few questions informed me of what type of concertgoer each participant was -- asking their favourite genre, the size of the venues they frequent, and how often they attend live music performances. I also asked how often the participants communicate directly with musicians through their social media presences. Next, the survey focused on concert behaviours. Participants were asked in which actions they typically partake at live music performances; choices included applauding, headbanging, and holding up lighters. They were asked how they might like to interact with their favourite performer and what sort of message they would send them if they could. I asked for their thoughts on getting involved in performances, bringing new technologies into concert settings, and interacting with musicians using social media services. (For complete results, see Appendix X.)

% Present the direct results:
The results were not shocking but certainly informative. Most participants favoured rock music or some variation (``indie," ``alternative"); the majority attended multiple concerts per year -- some even on a weekly basis; and most usually went to shows at small- to medium-sized venues. The majority of participants claimed to communicate with artists through social media either sometimes or regularly, though a sizeable amount indicated they never do this. The most popular concert actions were applauding, singing along with the performer, clapping or stomping to the beat, dancing, jumping up and down, and chanting words or phrases along with the other audience members. When asked how they might want to interact with a performance, many said they would like to choose the songs that are played, while much fewer expressed interest in manipulating visuals and contributing to the music; around one quarter of participants stated they did not have interest in directly influencing a live music performance at all. Given the opportunity to communicate with their favourite performer, most participants responded with praise or appreciation (``Thank you," ``I love you!"). Other messages included song requests and suggestions like, ``Don't bury the vocals," or ``More rock, less talk!" The majority of participants indicated that they enjoy when performers ask them to participate in a performance -- clapping or singing along or call and response, for example. Lastly, the majority also said they were excited by the idea of bringing new technologies into a live music setting.

% Present the results of the in-depth analysis:
Upon further analysis of the responses, some correlations were uncovered. There are clear relationships between show-going frequency, venue size, and interest in interaction and technology. Participants attending shows more frequently are more likely to visit smaller venues. This group also expressed the most interest in being involved in performances; they are more inclined to interact with their favourite artists via social media; and they are more welcoming to the idea of unfamiliar technology in a concert setting. The opposite, thus, can also be said: participants who go to fewer shows tend to go to larger venues, are more likely to refrain from participating in shows, are less likely to contact artists through social media, and are less interested in new technologies.


\section{Performers}

% Explain the recruitment process and describe the participants:
With a broad overview of audience attitudes, the next step was to speak directly with actual performers and discuss the same topics with them. Three musicians were recruited -- Erik Grice, Blake Enemark, and Christian Hansen. These three were selected because I was familiar with their bands and felt that they represented three distinct performance styles within the rock genre. The subjects have different backgrounds as performers, experience playing in different parts of Canada, and for a range of audience sizes. They also have slightly different relationships with modern technology. While their opinions are representative of modern rock musicians, it should be kept in mind that these subjects are also music fans who enjoy watching others perform as well; thus, they are also sharing their perspective as concertgoers.

% Outline the interview questions
After briefly establishing their history as performers, I asked them each about what audience participation means to them. The musicians were shown video of some of my case study subjects (including Xylobands, Wham City Lights, and Kasabian's 2011 tour), and I recorded their reactions and general thoughts on technology-enabled performances. Lastly, the artists were asked if and how they would want to incorporate similar participatory technologies into their own shows.

\subsection{The Subjects}

\subsubsection{Erik}
Erik Grice grew up outside of Edmonton, Alberta. He performed musical theatre as an adolescent and started playing in bands in his teens. After acting as a vocalist and guitarist in previous bands, Erik now plays drums for Edmonton-based The Fight -- an alternative rock band with soul undertones. The Fight's typical audience size can range from twenty at road shows to over one hundred people at home shows. Venues are usually small clubs or halls. They have also played acoustic shows at cafes or similar venues. A typical Fight concert is energetic yet composed. Audience members can comfortably move to the music and may be welcomed to sing along with certain choruses.

\subsubsection{Blake}
Blake Enemark is originally from Victoria, British Columbia. He picked up guitar as a teenager and started playing covers in bands. Blake recorded and toured with alt-country band Forestry in 2010. Shortly after, he was recruited to join We Are The City, a Vancouver based progressive rock band who had just gained nation-wide recognition after winning the \$150 000 Peak Performance award. With this group, Blake experienced audience more sizeable and fanatic than he had experienced before, culminating in a performance for around two thousand people in Vancouver's Stanley Park. Blake parted ways with We Are The City shortly thereafter, going on to tour with folk group Northcote, before starting his own project called Snoqualmie. Snoqualmie, described as ``high-gain, sad-sack Canadiana," marks a return to songwriting and more intimate shows for Blake.

\subsubsection{Christian}
Christian Hansen has a theatre background, a graduate of the University of Alberta's acting program. He began playing in bands as a teenager. During his university degree, Christian rediscovered his desire to perform music and began playing acoustic shows. He eventually started performing with his now-wife Molly and began incorporating drum machines and prerecorded tracks into his work, which was becoming more like dance music. Christian Hansen \& The Autistics were formed. When Molly could not make it to one show, Christian was inspired to put all of his energy into his performance to make up for it; this was a ``lightbulb moment for him." Christian Hansen \& The Autistics soon gained notoriety around Edmonton for their high-energy shows, and their songs received a lot of radio play. Christian and Molly moved to Toronto in 2011, shortening their band name to Christian Hansen and now playing music described as new wave. While they are currently working their way into Toronto's music scene, Christian Hansen typically draw around five hundred excited showgoers when they play in Alberta.

\subsection{Audience Participation}

\subsubsection{Erik}
The Fight encourage some forms of participation at their shows. Their lead singer can often walk out and physically touch audience members, looking them in the eye as he sings. They will invite the crowd to sing and/or clap along for suitable songs. Erik felt that this sort of participation typically makes for better shows: ``An attentive and participating crowd of fifty people is always going to be better than two hundred people who are standing there with blank faces." He explained that the ideal audience will match the energy that the band exudes. In addition to making the show more enjoyable, he said, this also makes musical flubs less significant to everyone present. Erik felt that it is the band's job to keep the audience's attention. They must make decisions based on the venue, the audience, the length of the set. Stage banter is usually only implemented to convey pertinent information to the crowd. Talking to audience members after the show has gotten the band extra shows, radio spots, places to stay for the night. 

\subsubsection{Blake}
Blake is a self-described introvert. While he is certainly the leader of his current band, he expressed a preference for playing in the background. Despite being typically shy with audiences, Blake recognized the significance of even basic audience participation. Singing and clapping along makes you feel like a part of the show. He also expressed the impact this might have on performers; ``It would be the most flattering thing in the world for me for someone to sing my song back to me," he said. Blake noted, however, that different performers react to audience participation differently. A guitarist in his former band, for instance, would not allow the audience to clap along. Furthermore, ``There's a fine line," Blake stated, ``between drunken participation and intentional participation." He acknowledged the prominence of alcohol in live music settings and the importance of alcohol sales at most venues. It is a part of the industry, he said, and it plays a role in how audiences behave.

\subsubsection{Christian}
Christian felt that it is the responsibility of the performer alone to ensure a concert is enjoyable. If he puts all of his energy into a show, he explained, all he can hope is that the audience reciprocates: ``If we come in at 200\%, maybe the audience will get to 100\%." Christian emphasized the importance of responding to the audience. If they are standing far from the stage, he will encourage them to get closer. If certain individuals are especially invested in the show, he will make eye contact with them and sing directly to them. Christian encourages singalongs and will sometimes hold the microphone in front of those who are singing loudly. He may even leave the stage and make physical contact with the crowd if they seem particularly comfortable. At their most recent Edmonton concert, Christian entered the audience and performed the last song unplugged, the crowd surrounding him and singing along with him. For him, this moment as ``amazing, magical." While he acknowledged that every audience is different, Christian felt that getting the audience involved generally increase the intensity of a show.

\subsection{Social Media}

\subsubsection{Erik}
The Fight make use of popular social media channels. They use Facebook to advertise, organize contests and giveaways, and share information on their live dates. Twitter is used for communicating with fans and other artists. This has helped them open slots for touring bands. At shows, the band hands out cards with links to their social media pages. Erik believed there is a levelling out between artists and fans, and he likes this. He explained that some contemporaries try to maintain personas and seem ``untouchable": ``It's stupid to have those kinds of pretences," he said. He noted that, for larger bands, direct interaction with fans is more difficult, but overall the extra freedom is nice.

\subsubsection{Blake}
The internet presence of Blake's current band is ``not very good." Blake himself recently closed his Facebook account for personal reasons. Despite this, he recognizes the importance it holds for artists: ``It's bridging gaps that have never been bridged before." He had an especially meaningful experience with the Reddit community; after an anonymous user posted a link to his music, Blake began receiving orders from all over the world -- the southern United States, Poland, Japan. ``You never know who's listening," he said, ``It's empowering and terrifying."

\subsubsection{Christian}
Christian embraces connecting with fans through social media. He accepts friend requests from fans on his personal Facebook account and does his best to respond to every message he receives. Despite a few negative online experiences, he Christian enjoys interacting with fans in this way.

\subsection{Participatory Technologies}

At this point in the interview, the musicians were shown images of some of the projects that were outlined in Chapter 3. These included PixMob, Xylobands, Wham City Lights, Plastikman's SYNK, and the Amex Unstaged: Usher project.

\subsubsection{Erik}
Erik responded negatively to the projects that relied on smartphones; he feels they would be mostly distracting, and he expressed concern about possible being responsible for people dropping and damaging their devices. ``What can't your phone do now?" he asked. Rather, he favoured the work that had other tangible elements, like the PixMob beach balls. Erik felt that every show should be unique. An attendee should be able to go home and say, ``I was at that one" -- a digital analogue to the classic concert tee with dates listed on the back. Some artists post photos and set lists from each of their shows, he explained, and even this makes a show feel personal for those who attended. If the set changes slightly each night, this amplifies the effect, as well as keeping things interesting for the performer. Erik felt that these sorts of technologies should allow people to opt out without affecting the others' experience. However, he also expressed concern about giving power to all audience members. Something like a Twitter feed is surely edited. Bands that hand out percussion instruments like tambourines have to deal with participants with no rhythm. Erik provided an anecdote about a band that gave miniature harmonicas to audience members to be played during one part of one song; the crowd continued to play the instruments throughout the whole set and the other bands' sets.

\subsubsection{Blake}
Blake commented on the importance of context. An experimental performance may only be successful if the crowd is filled with fans of the artist. He felt that a festival-type setting might be more suitable than a small rock club. Blake remarked on the effectiveness of these projects with large audiences. He recounted an experience seeing U2 perform; the stadium lights were extinguished, and the crowd was instructed to hold up their open cellphones, filling the space with an electric glow. While Blake was concerned that the technologies I showed him may border on gimmicky, he admitted that creating a spectacle has become a significant part of performing: ``You gotta have something that's more than the music," he said, ``You can't be like the Beatles anymore and just record albums and be successful. There has to be an angle." Although Blake admitted the importance of creating a memorable experience for concertgoers, he seemed to lament the current attitude towards live music: ``A lot of people are just there to have a good time. And if you can make them have a good time then you're a good musician. It's a little discouraging." He was also wary of the amount of video recording at modern concerts, explaining that something is lost in a recording. ``A concert's an experience," he said, ``Go and soak it in and remember it and let it sit in your memory."

\subsubsection{Christian}
Christian admired the way the projects all seem to aim to ``unite" the participants; ``There's not a lot of times when we feel that we're united," he said. He also remarked on the size of the audience in the examples and wondered if similar effects could be replicated with smaller venues and smaller budgets. Christian speculated that perhaps these technological spectacles are especially useful at large shows because the performers are so distant from audience members. Having played a handful of shows at larger venues, he has dealt with open spaces that dissipate energy and guardrails that divide performer and audience; these technologies could be responses to this divide. When asked about incorporating similar technologies in his own shows, Christian was at first hesitant. He expressed concern about giving up the ``rawness" of the performance; technology could take audiences out of the show. He was also wary of giving up control of the show. However, he quickly backed up, noting that ``some of the best gigs are when I felt pretty out of control." Giving the audience some control over the lights or even the set list could be appealing, he admitted, although he would not want the crowd dictating the whole structure of the performance. Christian explained that his sets are organized around tension and release; any audience interaction would have to keep the overall flow of the performance in tact. An ideal system would follow a plan while allowing for the spontaneity that will make the show memorable.  Overall, Christian had no reservations about tech-enabled shows. ``It's a natural evolution," he explained; technology has always helped to move rock music forward. ``That's why I love rock and roll... There's no rules." 


\section{Analysis}

A few general conclusions can be made from the questionnaire results that are particularly relevant to my research question. It is encouraging to confirm that most participants are not quietly standing still at live performances; they are cheering, moving, and singing along. A surprising find was that, given the chance to say anything to their favourite artist on stage, most participants would choose simple messages of praise or thanks -- something ostensibly achieved already by applauding. Also intriguing was the relative lack of interest in influencing lights and visualizations. Instead, the majority of participants showed great interest in choosing the set list for the performance. Regardless, it is clear that most respondents have little to no reservations about being directly involved in a show and doing so with new technologies. Seemingly, this willingness to interact is more common in those who frequently attend performances at smaller venues. Perhaps, then, artists that play to smaller crowds and can offer more direct interactions both on and off stage have fan bases that are more willing to experiment with new interactions.
